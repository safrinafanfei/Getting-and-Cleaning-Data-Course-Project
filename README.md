# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
About this repo
The files in this repo were created for the course project for the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data.

runAnalysis.R

This file takes the raw data and outputs a clean tidy data as the result. It works with data collected from the accelerometers from a smartphone (too large to upload to this repo. You have to download and include in your working directory in order for the R script to work!). Once you have the data downloaded and included in your directory, running the R script will walk through five steps and output a tidy data file.

data_cleaned.txt

This is the tidy data file output from Run_analysis.R.

CodeBook.md

The Code Book describes the variables and their units in the tidy data file, and the decisions I made along the data processing process.

All work belongs to @safrinafanfei.
